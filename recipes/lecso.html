    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hungarian lecsó (LEH-choh) is a vegetable stew that combines three of Hungary's favorite ingredients—peppers, tomatoes, and paprika. Hungary's national spice is paprika, so you will see it in their cuisine, especially in stews and goulashes.</p>
    <p>Lecsó can be served variously as a vegetable side dish, appetizer, or the main meal itself (see the variations below). Many cooks preserve lecsó by processing it in a hot water bath to be used in the winter months. It's similar to Serbian djuvece, Russian letcho, and French ratatouille.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons bacon grease, or oil</li>
        <li>1 pound peppers, such as Hungarian wax, banana, Italian, or green bell peppers, cut into 1/4-inch strips</li>
        <li>3 large ripe, peeled and chopped tomatoes, or use shortcut below</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweet Hungarian paprika</li>
    </ul>
