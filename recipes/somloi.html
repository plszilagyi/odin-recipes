    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This decadent Hungarian trifle recipe is known as somloi galuska (shom-loh-ee gah-LOOSH-kaw) and is made with three different-flavored sponge cakes, pastry cream, raisins, walnuts, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream.</p>
    <p>The traditional presentation is to scoop three balls of this dessert into a bowl or on a plate, dollop with whipped cream and garnish with chocolate sauce. A modern presentation is to cut it into squares so the different layers are evident. Rum is traditionally used in the simple syrup and chocolate sauce, but it can be omitted.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Walnut Sponge Cake</li>
        <li>1 Cocoa Sponge Cake</li>
        <li>1 Plain Sponge Cake</li>
        <li>Vanilla Pastry Cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare plain sponge cake, cocoa sponge cake, and walnut sponge cake per recipe instructions.</li>
        <li>Prepare vanilla pastry cream per recipe instructions.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the Rum Simple Syrup by stirring the sugar, water, and orange and lemon zest, if using, in a small saucepan over medium heat until boiling. Continue to boil without stirring until the syrup has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. Cool completely and stir in the rum, if using, and remove the zests, if using.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, boil apricot preserves over medium heat and keep warm. Combine walnuts and raisins in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place walnut sponge cake in the bottom of a 13x9-inch rectangular pan. Brush with 1/3 rum simple syrup, then spread with warm apricot preserves. Spread 1/3 pastry cream over the preserves and 1/2 the walnut-raisin mixture.</li>
        <li>Next, place the cocoa sponge cake in the pan, pressing down lightly. Brush with 1/3 rum simple syrup and 1/3 pastry cream. Sprinkle remaining walnut-raisin mixture on top.</li>
        <li>Top with plain sponge cake, pressing down lightly. Brush with remaining rum simple syrup and remaining 1/3 pastry cream. Sift 3 tablespoons cocoa powder over top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>To make the Rum Chocolate Sauce: In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring 3/4 cup water, 3 tablespoons rum (if using), 6 ounces chopped chocolate and 3/4 cup sugar to a boil, stirring often. Reduce heat and cook at a brisk simmer, stirring often, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Cool slightly and serve warm.</li>
        <li>To serve: The traditional presentation is to use a 2-inch ice cream scoop and place three "dumplings" in a bowl or on a dessert plate, then pipe with sweetened whipped cream and drizzle with the Rum Chocolate Sauce. A modern presentation is to cut the dessert into squares to show off the layers and then garnish with whipped cream and sauce.</li>
